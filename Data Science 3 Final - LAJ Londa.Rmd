There are many steps in transitioning to be a data-driven business. One of these mature data-driven businesses is McDonald’s, an American fast-food company with operations in over 100 countries across 37,855 outlets as of 2018. McDonald’s used data to optimize their services and create efficiency in the business process, additionally by also exploiting the gap in the market (Chicago Tribune, 2018)(Software Advisory Service, n.d.). 
The definition of mature data-driven business is when an organization has a solid and clear data strategy, managing the data through its relevancy, and full commitment from the management with data (KPMG,2018).

Features of data culture have different characteristics according to different sources. Forbes classifies it as Commitment, Trust (data sharing), Talent (data literacy and skills), and Sharing (collaboration)(Huffman, 2021). Tableu classifies it as applying data-driven decision making, using data to achieve a business goal, and creation of an open and encouraging community concerning data use (Tableu, n.d). Datacamp decides the feature of data culture as data fluency in the organization, employees involvement with data, skilled human resources with data, and constant feedback for the data usage and application (Data Camp, n,d,). 
Transition steps to become a mature data-driven business is a long process as a mature data-driven business is also accompanied by a data culture. Harvard business reviews outline three steps needed to take the step to become a mature data-driven business. First, the organization needed to start with high-impact uses with data that solve the business. This allows the firm to build momentum in data culture and credibility of data usage in the company. Secondly, the company needs to manage all relevant data. The last step is continuous improvement and investment in data for the company(Waller, 2021).

McDonald’s is a mature data-driven business because from the case study of their of data, that McDonald’s uses data extensively. They have a data culture which is necessary to manage their business because of their scale, to increase efficciency of their supply chain and adjusting their operation for different territories.
